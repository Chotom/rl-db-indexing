abstract="Index tuning in databases is a critical task that can significantly impact database performance. However, the process of manually configuring indexes is often time-consuming and can be inefficient. In this study, we investigate the process of creating indexes in a database using reinforcement learning. Our research aims to develop an agent that can learn to make optimal decisions for configuring indexes in a chosen database. The paper also discusses an evaluation method to measure database performance. The adopted performance test provides necessary documentation, database schema (on which experiments will be performed) and auxiliary tools such as data generator. This benchmark evaluates a selected database management system in terms of loading, querying and processing power of multiple query streams at once. It is a comprehensive test which results, calculated on measured queries time, will be used in the reinforcement learning algorithm. Our results demonstrate that used index technique requires repeatable benchmark with stable environment and high compute power, which cause cost and time demand.
